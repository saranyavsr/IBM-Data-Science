Insights of Air Quality using Python

The notebook contains the Analysis of Air quality of US States year 2017. These analysis will help identifying the places with high AQI and develop measures for preventing air pollution in US.
Below are the analysis steps :

1. Load the Air Quality data
2. Print Data Schema
3. Load Visualization Package (matplotlib, seaborn)
4. Print Unique values of the 'Parameter codeâ€™
5. Create an explorative scatter plot of data - Locations where the air quality observations are taken in US.
6. Scatter plot of data - Air Quality locations by state
7. Scatter plot of data - Air Quality locations categorized by Good, Moderate, Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups, Unhealthy.
8. Bar chart representation of states where the maximum recorded value of PM2 particles based on daily mean observed.
